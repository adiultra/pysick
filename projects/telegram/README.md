For using this you need the `telethon` library installed. Note that it works only for python 3. To install it use `pip install telethon` or `pip3 installl telethon` as per your preference.

> Note that it's also recomended to install the `cryptg` library for better download speeds

Create a `telegram_config.py` file using the given `telegram_config_sample` file here.

Then run any script you love, also it is recommended to install `cryptg`

# Downloader   

You are here obviously to download files from a telegram channel. The script downloader.py does just that.

Add your chats in the list of `telegram_config.py`, the script will create a folder named after the channel in `Downloads` and download all the media files there.
